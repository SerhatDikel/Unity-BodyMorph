## About
A tool for adjusting bone proportions in real time for Unity Humanoid Rigs.

# How to Use

To use the component, simply add BodyMorphLite to your character model.<br />
When there are changes in the feet and legs, you need to activate Kinematics for the character to fully touch the ground.<br />
If another IK is in use, the offset value can be accessed via "BodyMorphLite.Offset".<br />
Additionally, for ease of use, the Reset and Randomize functions can also be accessed from the context menu.<br />
<br />
BodyMorph Lite version is only compatible with only Humanoid Rigs*.
