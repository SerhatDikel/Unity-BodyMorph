BodyMorph Lite for Unity

A tool for adjusting bone proportions in real time for Unity Humanoid Rigs.

How to Use

To use the component, simply add BodyMorphLite to your character model.
When there are changes in the feet and legs, you need to activate Kinematics for the character to fully touch the ground.
If another IK is in use, the offset value can be accessed via "BodyMorphLite.Offset".
Additionally, for ease of use, the Reset and Randomize functions can also be accessed from the context menu.

BodyMorph Lite version is only compatible with only Humanoid Rigs*.
